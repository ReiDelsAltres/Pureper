pre-alpha — this library is in an early, pre-alpha stage and is under active development; APIs and behavior may change as the project evolves.

This package provides the core foundation utilities extracted from the Pureper SPA project (component lifecycle base classes, Triplet helper, Router, ServiceWorker helper, Fetcher, Theme, and selected helpers).
